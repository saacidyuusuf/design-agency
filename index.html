        </div>
        <div class="content-container">
            <div class="question"> <p> What design services do you offer? </p></div>
            <div class="answer">A design agency typically offers a range of design services, including graphic design, web design, branding and identity design, UX/UI design, product design, packaging design, and more.

            <div class="question"> <p>What is your design process? </p></div>
            <div class="answer">
                A design agency should have a clear and well-defined design process that they follow for each project.
                This process should include initial discovery and research, ideation and concept development, design 
                iterations and revisions, and final delivery and implementation. The agency should be able to explain
             their process to you and provide a timeline and milestones for your project.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="content-container">
            <div class="question"> <p>Can you provide examples of your past work?</p></div>
            <div class="answer">
                It's important to review a design agency's portfolio to see examples of their past work and ensure that their design style and quality meet your expectations.
             The agency should be able to provide a portfolio or case studies that showcase their design work and results.

        <div class="content-container">
            <div class="question"> <p>What is your pricing and payment structure? </p></div>
            <div class="answer">Design agency pricing can vary widely based on the scope and complexity of the project. It's important to ask the agency about their pricing and payment structure upfront to ensure that it aligns with your budget and expectations.
             Some agencies may charge a flat fee for a project, while others may charge hourly or have a retainer model.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content-container">
            <div class="question"> <p> What is your team structure and experience?</p></div>
            <div class="answer">Design agencies may have a team of designers, project managers, and other support staff.
             It's important to ask about the agency's team structure and experience to ensure that they have the expertise and resources needed to successfully complete your project.
             You may also want to ask about the specific designers who will be working on your project and review their portfolios.</div>
